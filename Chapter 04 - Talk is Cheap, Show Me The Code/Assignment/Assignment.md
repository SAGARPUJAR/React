# Theory

1. Is `JSX` is mandatory for React ?
2. Is `ES6` is mandatory for React ?
3. `{TitleComponent}` VS `<TitleComponent />` VS `<TitleComponent></TitleComponent>` ?
4. How I can write `comments` in `JSX` ?
5. What is `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>` and `<></>` ?
6. What is Virtual DOM ?
7. What is `Reconciliation` in React ?
8. Waht is `React Fiber` ?
9. Why we need to use `Key` in React ? When do we need `Keys` in React ?
10. Can we use `index` as `key` in React ?
11. What is `props` in React ? Ways to `Pass Props` into `component` ?
12. What is `Config Driven UI` ?

# Coding

* Build a Food Ordering App
    - Think of a cool name for your app
    - Build an `AppLayout`
    - Build a `Header Component` with `Logo` & `Nav Items` & `Cart`
    - Build a `Body Component`
    - Build `RestaurantList Component`
    - Build `RestaurantCard Component`
    - Use `static data initially`
    - Make your `card dynamic(pass in props)`
    - `Props` - passing arguments to a function - Use Destructuring & Spread operator
    - `Render` your cards with `dynamic data of restaurants`
    - Use `Array.map` to `render all the restaurants`    
**PS. Basically do everything that I did in the class, in the same sequence. Don't skip small things.**
